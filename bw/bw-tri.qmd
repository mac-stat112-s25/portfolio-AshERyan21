#|  A scatter plot with year on the x- axis from 1969 to 1988 and Births on the y axis ranging from 6,000 to a little over 12,000. The scatter plot is
#|  colored by day of the week, and it appears that sunday and saturday are at the lower end of the spectrum with wednesday, thursday and friday seeing the
#|  highest number of births. Over time the entire data set trends weakly positively up. The data was sourced from: Birthdays.
